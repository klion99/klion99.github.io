        <p> You ever woke up 5-10min before your alarm goes off? This happens because of stress hormones your body releases. It knows when to release them because your body has something called a biologic clock. When this clock gets used to a regular sleep schedule it becomes so reliable its even better than those crazy alarms! </p>
